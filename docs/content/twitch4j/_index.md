# Twitch4J

The Twitch4J Client Package includes the builder from the [getting started](../getting-started) section. Please visit those pages if you want to start using Twitch4J.

Furthermore it includes some `common code snippets`, for example to get followers or to track the go live events of a stream.
Please check out the [TwitchClientHelper](./client-helper) for such examples.
